# Trademark & Brand Policy

## Ownership

The following are owned by Affan ([@dziyaulaffan](https://github.com/dziyaulaffan)) and are **not** licensed under the project's MIT licence:

- The name **"LaTeX Word Counter"** and **"LatexWordCounter"**
- The tally-mark favicon and any associated logo assets
- The domain **latexwordcounter.com**

## What you can do

You are free to fork, modify, and redistribute the source code under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE). Open-source licences grant rights to the code — they do not grant rights to the project name, logo, or domain.

## What forks must do

If you distribute or publicly host a modified version of this project, you must:

1. **Rename it.** Do not use "LaTeX Word Counter", "LatexWordCounter", or any confusingly similar name.
2. **Remove the logo and favicon.** Replace them with your own.
3. **Remove any references to latexwordcounter.com.**

You *may* include a credit line such as "Based on [LaTeX Word Counter](https://latexwordcounter.com) by Affan" — but it must not imply endorsement or suggest that your version is the official tool.

## Why this policy exists

This policy exists to prevent confusion, not to restrict use of the code. Anyone should be able to tell the difference between the official project and a fork. If you have questions about whether a particular use is acceptable, open an issue or get in touch.
